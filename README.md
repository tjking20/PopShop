By creating categorized item lists (i.e. electronic, hardware, grocery, etc.), shopping lists will pop up on demand or when shoppers are in the vacinity of a store that matches a list that the client created. 
    
During a shopping session a corresponding list of items will pop up in a clickable notification. As the shopper purchases items, they are checked off and stored for later analysis and use.

As time progresses, a series of "smart" lists will have been constructed and will execute each time the shopper enters or approaches a corresponding retail establishment.
